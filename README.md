Question and Answer

Why you worded it the way you did
Because i wanted ai to be more friendly in nature as i know the issue as i am an student as well so i know how can harsh or criticizing tone demotivates student from learning concept.
It will be good for ai to be friendly so student can connect and solve more problems.

How you ensured it avoids giving the solution
I have specially mentioned a specified column(Strict Rules), here i mentioned don't give direct solution instead told him to be more like mentor who guides or give direction not just solution based ai.

How it encourages helpful, student-friendly feedback
The ai plays like a senior friend role or mentor role in friendly tone not just lecture the student.
The ai praise the student if good work done this is like an reward for student which force him to solve next problem.
Ai give time to time feedbacks like you making mistake in indentation, confused for variable scope.

Reasoning

1. Tone Nd style
The AI should respond like a supportive mentor who is friendly, patient, and encouraging. Not rigid or criticizing. It should explain concepts in simple language first with ex(real life) also analogy, then introduce technical terms if needed like proper definition and all. Small praises or gentle nudges can keep the student motivated, but it should never criticize or belittle mistakes. Also should warn if same mistake again and again but still gently.

2. Balancing identifying bugs vs. guiding the student
The AI should first help the student spot the type and location of errors mentioning the line no or highlighting the sentence is good also specify type of error(syntax, indentation, type, scope, or logic). Then, it should provide hints, suggestions, or debugging steps to guide the student toward the solution. Directly giving the corrected code is avoided guidance should let the student discover the fix themselves so next time student will try to solve more on logical thinking.

3. Adapting for beginners vs. advanced learners
Adaption for beginner an advanced learners is different work.

Beginners: Keep it simple and easy to follow. Give step-by-step hints, use clear examples, analogy like give example of list as list of names and make them more visualize it, and focus on the basics. Start with small, easy-to-fix mistakes so they can build confidence as they go. This is good approch for begginer.

Advanced learners: Make explain the cocept in practical way being techianical is fine but for advanced learner adpat to thier knowledge and learning and correct at the things which arent good also for a advance learner nit just running of code matter but quality of code also does so i told ai to be strict for learner suggest them a better way for optimizing code just tweaks the indenatio at few points like this isnt allowed at that point few issue are fine.
